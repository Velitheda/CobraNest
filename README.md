An android app of the classic Snake game

It is configured for Android Studio, and is nearly ready to release on the app store.  I just need to find a way to stop the blank activity screen showing briefly when it loads, and to stop an elusive bug where part of the wall dissapears when the snake crashes into it.

Steer the snake by swiping in the direction you wish to go in with your finger.  Eat strawberries, avoid walls.
